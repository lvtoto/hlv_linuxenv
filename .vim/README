1. What do the scripts do?
      These scripts do the syntax highlighting for SystemC files.

2. How does it work?
      If the syntax of the file is detected to be cpp, the first
      50 lines are scanned for some systemc specific keywords. If
      found, systemc highlighting is added, else the normal cpp
      highlighting is left

3. How to use it?

      Install instructions:
      
      For Windows:
      1. Copy 
            after/syntax/cpp.vim
               to
            $VIMRUNTIME/../vimfiles/after/syntax/
         Create the directory if it doesn't exist
      2. Copy
            plugin/CheckSysc.vim
               to
            $VIMRUNTIME/../vimfiles/plugin
         Create the directory if it doesn't exist
      For Unix:
      1. Copy
            after/syntax/cpp.vim
               to
            $HOME/.vim/after/syntax/
         Create the directory if it doesn't exist
      2. Copy
            plugin/CheckSysc.vim
               to
            $HOME/.vim/plugin
         Create the directory if it doesn't exist

4. Known limitations:
      1. There is no way to change the number of lines scanned (50)
         except by modifing the script itself
      2. There is no way to disable the SystemC highlighting
         and use only the normal cpp highlighting

5. Modification history:
      v1.0, Nov 30 2003 - First release
